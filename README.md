# nadocode-utilize1_game

This repository is for my python project following "Nadocoding" youtube channel's python lecture.

Lecture name: 파이썬 코딩 무료 강의 (활용편1) - 추억의 오락실 게임을 만들어 보아요. 3시간이면 충분합니다. [나도코딩]
Lecture URL: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMsa_0kAjjrd8hYYCwbAuDsXZmHpqHvlV

I am expecting to learn basic skills of python and some specilized python skills for game developing (which are actually not neccessary for my career, but learning them might be fun!)
