Files in this folder are documents about the first half of the course (Nadocoding's lecture 1)
They are almost same with the ones used at the lecture but some annotations may be little different.

You could get original files from Nadocoding's blog (https://nadocoding.tistory.com/8)

# I believe that '0_frame.py' is the most useful file in this folder
